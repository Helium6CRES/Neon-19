    "## Lifetime Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with what I want. Building up from simple things that work. Create simulated data to verify it's functioning. Use object oriented coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* A simple, object oriented set of scripts for analyzing half-life data. \n",
    "* Should work for both Ne19 and He6. Maybe even for anyone analyzing halflife data with the CAEN digitizer? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Begin with a simple exponential and add complexity from there. \n",
    "    * Next add a simple non-paralyzable dead-time model. \n",
    "    * Be sure to integrate over bin widths.\n",
    "* Use the data that was taken in Sept and Michael's code as a starting place. \n",
    "* Keep organized. This is # 1. \n",
    "* Use Brent's code and Kris's code and my own CreateFakeSpecSimple code as a guide and reminder. \n",
    "* Begin by writing the code into a ipynb and then hide that code away into scripts that are imported once things begin to work as you want them to. \n",
    "* In the end the ipynb should only contain a bit of code and should mostly just step through the analysis process which should be intuitive. \n",
    "* Simulate fake data to make sure we know it's working and also to get an idea for the stats we will need to take a competitive measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Structure:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a HalflifeAnalysis object that reads and breaks up the data. The data will be pd df's that are attributes of the HalflifeAnalysis object.\n",
    "    * The init function will call the splitter and create the attributes.\n",
    "* Then the differnt type of analysis' will be subclasses. \n",
    "    * The first one being SimpleExponential. Be sure to integrate over the bins. \n",
    "    * Use lmfit. Take time to understand the stats that you are doing. "

And all the class methods have access to both of these types of attributes. But generally I am working with instance attributes (self.Data)"
